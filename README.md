# Ring-structure
It has a center/center point, multiple loops/orbits around the center of the circle, and multiple objects distributed at the center and on different loops
# Circular Orbit
A system consisting of a single central point and multiple orbits in which multiple objects are carried, in which the objects may remain stationary or move continuously, and in which there may be connections between objects.
# Central Point
There is at most one object at the center that remains the same, the origin in the coordinate system (0,0).For example, the "sun" is the only object carried by the "center point" of the solar system, while the center point of the track and field of sports competition has no object.
# Track
A closed curve around the central point is generally circular, elliptic or other irregular shape, which is considered as a standard circle .The radius of an orbit is the distance between the orbit and the center point.
# Physical Object
Something specific that can be placed/assigned to a central point or track.Multiple objects can be carried in a multi-orbit system.Objects can only appear in the center or orbit, not in any other position.
# Position
In some applications, you need to consider the absolute position of an object in orbit (e.g., at time t, an object a is in orbit r; a's position is the point of polar coordinate system p, theta, and the radius of orbit r is p, theta is the Angle of object a.The origin (0, 0) of the polar coordinate system is the center point of the orbital system.In some applications, objects can jump on orbitals, such as an electron jumping from orbital 1 to orbital 2.In some applications, it is not necessary to consider the absolute position of objects, such as the position of electrons in atomic structures, the position of apps in mobile ecosystems, and the position of users in social networks.
# Relation
In some applications, there may be specific associations between objects at the center and other objects, between objects in the same orbit, and between objects in different orbits. The relation is limited to binary relation (that is, it can only occur between two objects) and undirected relation.If represented visually, a relationship is represented as a line (arrowhead free) connecting two points.
